# Meteo exercise

## Frontend unit testing

## App goal

- The goal here is to implement a small frontend app which will advise the user on how to dress depending on the weather.
- The webapp will use a fictional weather API provided by the module weather.js
  This API returns information about the current temperature and whether it's raining.
- You will have to be able to advise for at least 6 different outfits depending on the weather

## Testing goals

- You should implement unit tests for all the react components you create, for the function that calls the weather module, and for the function that determines what to wear depending on the weather.

## The weather module

- weather.js exports a `getWeather` function which will give you an object with the temperature and whether it's raining

## Resources

- Launch the app with `npm start`
- Launch the tests with `npm test`
